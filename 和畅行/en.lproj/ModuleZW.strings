"1、使用过程中应密切留意作用部位,若出现不适应立即停止使用。\n2、隔物灸仪工作时，灸头工作面中间的发热体的温度较高，严禁触摸！\n3、注意保暖:\n\t⑴ 一切准备妥当后再宽衣解带；\n\t ⑵ 除贴护垫和放置灸头时，短时间内暴露灸疗部位外，灸疗时不允许暴露灸疗部位，应有厚毛巾或棉被覆盖。身体的其他部位更不允许暴露；\n\t⑶ 冬天最好在温度不低于28℃、通风良好的室内施灸；夏天炎热，选择早晚凉爽时施灸。如果在空调房里施灸，空调温度不得低于28℃，并且要避开空调的出风口；春天、秋天施灸，也要注意保暖。\n\t⑷ 每次施灸结束时，特别是外感症，不要立即将灸头拿开，使施灸穴位的温度骤减。应停留几分钟，待施灸穴位的温度逐渐下降后再将灸头拿开。这样可避免风寒邪气乘穴道大开之时侵入。\n4、身上有汗、有水或油腻时，先擦拭干净后，再系绑带施灸，以防护垫滑落。\n5、灸疗过程中，每个人对热的耐受度不一样，不同的人应使用不同的灸疗温度;同一人不同的时间段、不同的部位、不同的穴位、不同经络耐温都不一样，应根据灸疗时的感觉分别调节输出温度。以不起泡为原则，以本人对热的耐受为度。\n6、建议灸疗时不要离开灸疗操作界面，以便感觉温度过高时，及时调低输出温度。\n7、灸疗结束后，不能马上离开灸疗的地方。应穿好衣服在原地停留10～15分钟才能离开；出汗者应等汗停后再离开。\n8、灸疗结束后，护垫的医用粘胶有可能和皮肤粘贴过紧，所以拆卸护垫时，动作应轻柔，避免弄伤皮肤。\n9、灸疗后，灸疗部位4小时内不能接触低于40℃以下的冷水。\n10、灸疗后调养：多喝热水，多吃营养丰富食物。\n11、一般每次灸疗时间以30~60分钟为宜；温度以45℃左右为宜。" = "1. Pay close attention during use and stop immediately in case of any discomfort. \n2. While working, temperature of the heater in middle of moxibustion head is high. Do not touch!  \n3. Keep warm: \n\t(1) Undress when everything is ready; \n\t(2) Do not expose moxibustion site or other parts of your body during moxibustion other than short time exposure when sticking pads and placing the device. The site should be covered with a thick towel or quilts. \n\t(3) In winter, it is better to apply moxibustion in a well-ventilated room with a temperature not lower than 28 °C; in hot summer, do moxibustion in morning and evening when it is cool. If you want to do moxibustion in an air-conditioned room, make the temperature not lower than 28 °C, and avoid the air outlet of the conditioner; in spring and autumn, keep warm during moxibustion. \n\t(4) At the end of each moxibustion, especially in case of exogenous dyndrome, do not remove the device immediately, which can make the acupoint moxibustioned decline quickly.  Keep it for a few minutes and remove it when the acupuncture cools down gradually, which prevents the intrusion of the wind and cold pathogenic factors when the acupoint is open.\n5. During moxibustion, people's tolerance to heat is different. So different people should select different moxibustion temperatures. Even for one person, the temperature tolerance for different time phases, body parts, acupoints and meridians differs. Output temperature should be adjusted as per one's feeling, just not to cause blisters. \n6. It is recommended not to quit operation interface during moxibustion, so that you can lower the temperature in time when feeling too hot. \n7. In the end of moxibustion, do not leave the place of moxibustion immediately. You should put on clothes and stay in place for 10 to 15 minutes before leaving; if you sweat, wait until it stops before leaving. \n8. In the end of moxibustion, the medical adhesive of the pad may be still tightly attached to your skin, so be gentle when removing the pad to avoid hurting the skin. \n9. After moxibustion, the site moxibustioned should be free from cold water below 40 °C within 4 hours. \n10. Nursing after moxibustion: drink hot water and take more nutritious food. \n11. Generally, 30 to 60 minutes per moxibustion is suitable, with temperature around 45 °C.";
